# Alexandre Caruso Personal Website 

Personal website **designed to use static content**, built from scratch using with **React**. 

Check the commits to understand how I have configured it with **webpack** bundler, **JSX with babel** and **SASS with dart-sass loader**.

### How to run development
1. Clone the repo
2. ``npm install``
3. ``npm run dev``

## Next steps
Because this is a personal project, expect a slow iteration process. Nevertheless, next steps are: 
- Include unit and integration tests
- Integrate some kind of (free) API (still planning)
- Add portfolio as **Creative Planner** (2009), **Designer** (2010) and **Developer** (2007)
